    This is how the great pasta is made !</h1>
    <p style="background-color: lightsteelblue;"> Boil Water: Fill a pot with water and bring it to a rolling boil. Use about 4-6 quarts (3.8-5.7 liters) of water for every 1 pound (450g) of pasta.

        Add Salt: Once the water is boiling, add a generous amount of salt. A common guideline is about 1-2 tablespoons of salt per pound of pasta. This enhances the flavor of the pasta.
        
        Add Pasta: Gently add the pasta to the boiling water. Stir immediately to prevent it from sticking together. Refer to the package instructions for the recommended cooking time, but you can taste-test for doneness.
        
        Stir Occasionally: Stir the pasta occasionally while it cooks to prevent sticking. Keep it at a rolling boil.
        
        Test for Doneness: Taste a small piece of pasta to check for doneness. It should be "al dente," which means it's cooked but still slightly firm when bitten.
        
        Drain: Once the pasta is ready, turn off the heat and carefully drain it in a colander. Be sure to save a cup of pasta cooking water if you plan to make a sauce.
        
        Serve: Your pasta is ready to be served. You can add your favorite sauce, herbs, or grated cheese as desired  </p>
